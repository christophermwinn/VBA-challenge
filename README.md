# VBA-challenge

This repository contains the VBA code used for the stock market activity.

For each worksheet, code was executed to:
Determine the ticker symbol, yearly change in open and closing price, percentage change, and total yearly volume, and write these values to a summary table
Calculate the stocks with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest volume, and write these values to an additional table
These steps were repeated for each worksheet in the file.

Macro enabled Excel file is included, as are screen shots for each year.

Thank you!
